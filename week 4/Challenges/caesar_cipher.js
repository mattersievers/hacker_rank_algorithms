// Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. 
// Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. 
// If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. 
// In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c.
// Input:
// The unencrypted string s, and k, the number of letters to rotate the alphabet by.
